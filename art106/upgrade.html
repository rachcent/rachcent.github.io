<p> Q1. When you think of the term 'upgrade', do you think more of your own brain being enhanced or more of your body? Which do you think you are more likely to be personally invested in, given the money and risks involved?</p>
<p> A: I would think more of my brain being enhanced. I thought it would be nice just to be able to have more knowledge of things, for example, being able to calculate things without having to pull out an actual calculator. I would like to know different languages. An example I said was doing karate but in class, they made a point about not really being able to physically fight well because our body might not be able to process it. You need muscle memory and body conditioning to work on that knowledge. There’s definitely more risk because there’s not much research about this but if there is more research I’d definitely like to enhance my brain. </p>
<p>Q2. Regarding the idea of enchancing technology that will be directly placed 'onto' or 'into' ourselves, what do you see as the direction(s) humans are going to evolve in the future. What do you think will be the factors and mechinisms that drive this?</p>

<p> A:I think physical enhancements are going to evolve in the future. I think that prosthetics will be improved to make it look more aesthetically more pleasing and more comfortable for those who need it. Even for shoes, for example, have been made for a long time, we still have the issues of shoes being just built to be uncomfortable. Unless, for example you spent $200 for the adidas ultra boosts. I think physical prosthetics for mobility, sight, hearing, etc. will be the first things to evolve first before other things.</p>

<p>Q3. Would you prefer for technology to become more visible or invisible in our everyday experience. Should all of this technology be inbedded in ourselves and our environment (invisible), or would you prefer to see it, to touch it, for it to be more a part from you and more in our faces (visible)? </p>
<p>A: I would like technology to be more visible because I’m kind of uncomfortable to not be able to see technology be visible. I already feel uncomfortable enough that my data is being used to get me to buy things or to influence me when I use my social media. I’ve also seen episodes of Black Mirror of that episode of people being able to record with their eyes and that’s eerie. Personally, I’d like it to be sort of separate from my body, but if it's something small embedded like a chip so I have access to my own house I wouldn’t mind doing a procedure like that since it’s small.</p>

<p> A: Answering the first question, Krystal made a really good idea about being able to increase emotional intelligence so that people are able handle situations in a better way. Also, being able to like switch off emotions when you don’t want to feel depressed or sad. I thought that was a good idea. Kevin on the other hand thought that if we did increase emotional intelligence, does that make us more human or lesser or a human? I kind of understood his point. Because I felt like if everyone kind of acted the same, and if there was a way to dictate or facilitate increased emotional intelligence I kind of felt like we’d almost be like robots. It’s kind of hard to explain. Everyone in the group thinks that it's going to be more physically enhancing technology that will be evolved more and to make us look more “normal”. We also had the same thoughts about having technology being more visible.</p>
