<p>CH 1</p>
<p> 1. Summarize the distinction(s) from the traditional Klines &  Clines definition of the cyborg vs. the one that Clark is proposing as the main thesis of his book? </p>
<p> A: I would think more of my brain being enhanced. I thought it would be nice just to be able to have more knowledge of things, for example, being able to calculate things without having to pull out an actual calculator. I would like to know different languages. An example I said was doing karate but in class, they made a point about not really being able to physically fight well because our body might not be able to process it. You need muscle memory and body conditioning to work on that knowledge. There’s definitely more risk because there’s not much research about this but if there is more research I’d definitely like to enhance my brain. </p>
<p>2. From The book, "Cyberneticists were especially interested in self-regulating systems." What are 2 or more example of these, make sure to include both biological systems and also non-biological systems.</p>

<p> A:I think physical enhancements are going to evolve in the future. I think that prosthetics will be improved to make it look more aesthetically more pleasing and more comfortable for those who need it. Even for shoes, for example, have been made for a long time, we still have the issues of shoes being just built to be uncomfortable. Unless, for example you spent $200 for the adidas ultra boosts. I think physical prosthetics for mobility, sight, hearing, etc. will be the first things to evolve first before other things.</p>

<p>3. What other kind of definitions of a hybrid humans are there that are not based on definations above but popular in literture, media culture, etc.</p>
<p>A: I would like technology to be more visible because I’m kind of uncomfortable to not be able to see technology be visible. I already feel uncomfortable enough that my data is being used to get me to buy things or to influence me when I use my social media. I’ve also seen episodes of Black Mirror of that episode of people being able to record with their eyes and that’s eerie. Personally, I’d like it to be sort of separate from my body, but if it's something small embedded like a chip so I have access to my own house I wouldn’t mind doing a procedure like that since it’s small.</p>

<p>CH 2</p>
<p> 1. Summarize a definition as described in the book of what the significant attributes  are for 'opaque' technology vs.   'transparent' technology.</p>
<p>One of the main differences between these terms is that opaque technology is more software driven and transparent technology is on the hardware side. Examples of transparent technology is old school technology such as pen, paper, watches, written words. Another example is musical instruments and spots equipment.  Opaque distinguishes deeply and gradually between the user and the tool in a cognitive way.  Transparent technology is being fitted into our lives and how it's integrated. Opaque technology seems to cause issues for the users, requiring skills and capacities.An opaque technology is a PC which a lot users experience crashing and hardware/software issues even though they know how to use it. </p>
<p> 2. Give some examples of technology that might be better served if it were more transparent and and also give some example of a technology that should be more opaque.</p>
<p>Technologies that might be better transparent would probably be social media algorithms. I think social media should be transparent about bringing the user awareness that their data is being taken from them. I’m not sure if many people are aware still, I still think it needs to be brought to the forefront. Another technology that should be opaque should probably  be body prosthetics for things like legs, arms, hands. I think they should be pretty and aesthetics for people to wear, not for it to be ugly, displeasing, uncomfortable to wear. </p>
<p> 3.Does the watch and dictionary example discussed in the book, seem valid to you? Why? </p>
<p>David Landes explains that throughout history we have been biologically self-taught about “time obedience.”  Time signals moments. It definitely tells a significance of a period of time of information or data that was placed at that time. The dictionary helps with words you don’t understand. I definitely agree that technology should be easier to access, easy to use, and affordable. When we have technologies for example, like a calculator in our phone, it helps us like take in other information since a calculator is pretty much integrated into our phones. </p>
