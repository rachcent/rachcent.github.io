<h3>CH 3</h3>
<p>Summary: In CH 3 NBC talks and gives examples of how our bodies are connected to the brain. Human brains can project feeling and sensation besides the human body itself. An example issuing blind stick or a tennis racket that extends the user’s bodies and senses. Example is phantom limb patients, can fool brains of patients who feel their body part (amputated) is feeling motion, pain, can use a box and mirror to cast into the space “occupied” by the phantom. The patient can clench into the amputated part to relieve pain.
Experiment 3 the sensation in the dummy hand where the volunteer taps real hand (hidden in view) and dummy hand at same time. Subject experience sensations in “dummy hand”. Turns out that the body-image supported by the biological brain is plastic, highly and rapidly responsive to coordinated signals from the environment. Image of our bodies aligned to our pains and pleasures is highly negotiable.Mental construct and can be open to reconfigure and updated. One of the reasons was because our bodies change throughout our lifetime. Limbs develop and grow and sometimes are lost.</p>


<p> 1. Related to the text descriptions of how our senses work with our brain, explain your experiences where your senses have momentarily misled you or someone you know. Give examples of this.</p>

<p>A: An example of this experience is probably being drunk. Once you're drunk, the more bearable it is to drink. It’s because alcohol dulls our senses, which is our sense of taste.Optical illusions is an example that tricks the human eye to make people think something is moving ior if things are far away.</p>

<p> 2. What does the 'The Early Adopters Dream Technology' example on page 80 and the mangrove analogy starting on page 81 say about the role of language and its relationship to thought and meaning. Do you agree with the Author's assertions? Whether you agree or not, please explain why.</p>

<p> A: I agree with the author about language and its relationship to thought and meaning because it helps tell people stories, ideas, and tell history. Then, it can be passed on from one person to another. It then facilitates reasoning and thinking.</p>

<p>3.The Ideas of 'meta learning' (page 67) and constructive learning (page 83) are brought up in this chapter. What do these 2 ideas have in common in terms of the process of learning and using information and memory. Please eloborate your thoughts on how you can 'learn' something from this.</p>

<p> A: Meta knowledge is knowledge about how to acquire and exploit information,
Constructive learning is whose own basic computational and representational resources alter and expand(or construct) as systems learns, build tools to learn more things, scaffold knowledge.Constructive learning use early learning to build new basic structures upon which to base later learning. ( based off of your own experiences)Constructive learning and meta learning have in common is being able to use information that they learn. We can use different methods to find different ways of learning. (Ex. grade school ---> highschool ---> college)</p>

<h3>CH 4</h3>
<p> Summary: Chapter 4 is how we can use technology to alter the sense of our bodies and mind. We're able to have different experiences based on the technology that is being developed and these two interactive technologies and passive experience. </p>
<p>One of the main differences between these terms is that opaque technology is more software driven and transparent technology is on the hardware side. Examples of transparent technology is old school technology such as pen, paper, watches, written words. Another example is musical instruments and spots equipment.  Opaque distinguishes deeply and gradually between the user and the tool in a cognitive way.  Transparent technology is being fitted into our lives and how it's integrated. Opaque technology seems to cause issues for the users, requiring skills and capacities.An opaque technology is a PC which a lot users experience crashing and hardware/software issues even though they know how to use it. </p>
<p>1. What are the 2 main componants of action discussed in the book, that is required for Telepresence to exist and function properly?</p>

<p>A:The worlds of speech and text play an important role for telepresence to exist and function properly. (ie communication) The ability to be somewhere even though you live the distance using visual/hearing/body manipulation. For example, Zoom using visual/hearing through a webcam/computer screen. </p>

<p>2. What form of Telepresence do you think you have experienced? If you have not. What was the closest to it, and what was missing for it to be not be telepresence? </p>

<p>A:Zoom, meeting in front of a webcam and talking through a computer. Talking on the phone or through text. Wii Sports, make it feel like your bowling or shooting an arrow. It’s almost simulated to make it feel like you're doing the sport when you're not.</p>

<p>3. Speculate on what other mechanics and sensory modalities that are based on Telepresence ideas, might be possible. What other ways can we be 'displaced' in their perception of where they are and what they can do. </p>

<p>A:I would probably say roller coaster rides. They can be hacked or rigged because there’s rides in Disneyland where it changes. For example, the Cars ride Radiator Spring Racers changes into two different tracks and different scenes. Another example is the Star Wars ride Millenium Falcon Smugglers Run and it's a simulation of riding/controlling the millennium falcon. One person can be the gunner, driver, engineer etc. but it randomizes depending on what card they give you when you get on the ride. Things like snapchat,or photo manipulation apps to change your appearance can be jacked or rigged to change people’s appearances.
