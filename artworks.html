<h2> Highlight, 2020 </h2>
<p> Vuforia, Unity, Adobe Premiere</p>


<p> In this work, I wanted to “highlight” stretch marks instead of it being hidden. There are many beauty apps like snow, snapchat, and programs like photoshop that are being used to manipulate and distort people’s bodies and faces to make them look flawless. Usually, we see those edits in movies, tv shows, Hollywood, but now it’s easily accessible to the public. It's getting really common and normalized too. I really wanted people to feel more comfortable in their own skin/bodies and for people to own up to it. I wanted to create an augmented reality app where the user can use a tablet/phone to pan over photograph's of people's stretchmarks. In that sense, highlight and bring forth stretchmarks instead of hiding them. </p>

<p> I photographed these images, used Paint Tool SAI to draw over the stretch marks, adobe premiere to make the animated video, then unity </p>

<h2> music paint tool, 2019 </h2>
<p>       p5      </p>


<p> I wanted to create music visuals by creating a brush that measures the applitude of the sound. Used p5 to create a music paint tool where when you draw, you can paint based on the applitude (how loud) of sound. The louder the music, the bigger the brush is. Music is very important to me. One of my favorite things to do is find new music to listen to. Listening to music live is a different experience than listening at home in headphones. From going to a lot of shows, I respect the production it goes to put on a great show. One of those is VJing. VJ's play live visuals of the music that creates a sense of being able to "see" music. I also wanted to connect it with synesthesia (being able to experience one of your senses with another), in which people have the ability to be able to see color in numbers, seeing a shape when tasting a food, see colors in sound, etc.  </p>
