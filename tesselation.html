<h3>Phase 1 </h3>
<p>1st pass: Exercise in Testing some 2d Tesselations and Origami Modules </p>

<p>I connected the shapes in which I made a circle and a folded flat box.</p>

<p>I connected the triangle angle and used the pockets to insert each module.</p>

<img src="projectassets/tesselation_1.jpg" alt="POC" style="width:100%"class="center">
<p>Created a simple triangle tesselation.</p>

<img src="projectassets/tesselation_2.jpg" alt="POC" style="width:100%"class="center">
<p>Messed with the colors and moved it around.</p>

<img src="projectassets/tesselation_3.jpg" alt="POC" style="width:100%"class="center">
<p>This one definitely made me think of flowers. We usually find math in nature. </p>

<h3>2nd Pass :Exercise in group Tesslation and Modularity with some 2d Shapes</h3>

<img src="projectassets/common.JPG" alt="POC" style="width:100%"class="center">
<p>Our group decided to start a diamond as shape. We made our own shapes and decided Edward's design to be the final common shape we all share.</p>

<img src="projectassets/shapes_rachel1.png" alt="POC" style="width:80%"class="center">
<p>This is my own design off of the common shapes.</p>

<img src="projectassets/Jerm_chart.png" alt="POC" style="width:100%"class="center">
<p>Group mates shapes to connect together.</p>

<img src="projectassets/JERM_Connected_Shapes4.png" alt="POC" style="width:100%"class="center">
<p>Final result of our shapes connceted created a scales/chain mail pattern. It mostly just connected diagonally like that since the top and bottom have to stay the same to connect with each other. I thought it was challenging to communicate that our shapes had somehow connect with each other. I thought each piece all had to incorporate our shape into the common connecter. Looking at other groups, I think we all were a bit confused of how our shapes should have connected. Our shapes put together cannot be pieced together, while other groups struggled to fill in the gaps of their modularity. It would be interesting to see checkered pattern instead of a stripe pattern I did when I was messing with colors. </p>

<h3>Phase 2: 3D Fastener BrainStorming Designs, Mockups and design approaches </h3>

<img src="projectassets/kirigami_fastener.jpg" alt="POC" style="width:100%"class="center">
<p>My inspiration came from product and packaging design. I always see these flaps and a cut slit being used to fasten food containers, boxes, and other products.</p>

<img src="projectassets/kirigami_cutout.jpg" alt="POC" style="width:100%"class="center">
<p>Used illustrator to draw and a cricket to cut out my shapes. So my shapes are basically a + shape which is almost forms a closed box. I added a cut out square for design.</p>

<img src="projectassets/kirigami_1.jpg" alt="POC" style="width:100%"class="center">
<p>I used an x-acto knife to cut a slit on part of the end to insert the tab. The fastener works really well because the rectangle hooks hangs onto the slit paper.</p>

<img src="projectassets/kirigami_2.jpg" alt="POC" style="width:100%"class="center">
<p>When using less parts, this can also be formed into a box shape, but with 6 pieces, ended up with a spherical shape.</p>

<img src="projectassets/kirigami_3.jpg" alt="POC" style="width:100%"class="center">
<p>It turned out well than I thought it would.</p>

<h3>Phase 2: Fastener Designs </h3>
<p>Fastener Designs </p>
<hr style="width:50%">

<img src="projectassets/joints.png" alt="POC" style="width:100%"class="center">
<p>Jason created a prototype of the finger joints.</p>


<img src="projectassets/fastener_design.JPG" alt="POC" style="width:100%"class="center">
<p>Marc made a really cool emblem design for our box TEAM JERM WHOO! </p>


<img src="projectassets/jerm_box_detail.JPG" alt="POC" style="width:100%"class="center">
<p>We were worked adding on other fasteners besides the finger joints. We revised the final versions and made sure everything connected and not overlap.</p>

<img src="projectassets/fastener_final_design.JPG" alt="POC" style="width:100%"class="center">
<p>We decided to create a box shape using finger joints. We also created something on top to add another layer of a box. There are different angle slots and key "fork" fasteners to connect each square on top of each other like a 3 tier cake almost. The material we will be using to lazer cut is wood and we hope that the edges and fasteners give us the freedom to place each square in a different way. It was very interesting trying to think of creating a 3D piece by creating a 2D Design. You really have to consider how the result will be once its actually put together.</p>
