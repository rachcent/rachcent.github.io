  <h3>Phase 2: Find and Print a Thingiverse Artifact</h3>

<br><p> David Z idea 1: In a world where humans can only grow up to 3 feet tall, everything that humans have built would be 3 times smaller. This would mean that there would be more space in the world and all our buildings, tools, etc, would be a mini sized version of what we have right now.<br>
<br>David'ds Artifact: The Statue of Liberty but 3 x smaller than its original size.<br>
<br> Rachel's Artifact: Shorter doorways, doors. <br>

<br>David Z Idea 2: In a world where apples are purple inside, there exists purple apple pie, canned purple apples, etc.
<br>David's Artifact: An apple cut in half with there being purple inside of it, or a purple apple pie.<br>
<br> Rachel's Artifact: Using the blue apples, can make dyed items like shirts. <br>

<br>Noor's idea: In a world of technology humans are all virtual reality
What if we live in a world with evolving technology, then now with AI we are slowly morphing into robots and questioning what is real and what is virtual. If we live a virtual world, then our reality is programed by an algorithm. <br>
<br>Noor's Artifact: a device that looks like a phone or glasses that serves as a portal between virtual reality and reality. <br>
<br> Rachel's Artifact: A technologically advanced mirror to see if your virtual or reality. <br>

<br>Rachel's Idea: In a world where clouds can be solid enough to jump and sleep on, fluffy

<br>Possibility to build another city
People can sleep on the clouds. Can jump, play around in the clouds.
Airplanes need to be cautious, other animals like birds can chill there<br>
<br> Rachel's Artifact: shoe/boot that specialize in cloud jumping/terrain of clouds, walking on clouds, or pillows</p>

<h3>Phase 3: Share your Rough Images and Story</h3>
<hr style="width:50%">

  <img src="modelassets/cloud9.png" alt="POC" style="width:100%"class="center">
  <p>My original idea about living in a world where clouds are solid enough to step on, look fluffy and comfy as they look. I thought of the possibility of how we have different footware for different terrain. (ie Snow shoes for walking on snow) I played with the idea about these sneakers being light weight, springy looking to jump on clouds. I called them Cloud9's.</p>
  <img src="modelassets/corralarchitecture.png" alt="POC" style="width:100%"class="center">
  <p>Noor's idea was the possibility of having a world where corral was extinct, we would utilize the corral into everyday objects like cups and furniture. To take this idea further, I thought about how many coral reefs are used to house 2 million species of marine life. These corral reefs are used as homes and so I thought of playing with the idea of a world where artists, scientists, architects and engineers work together to create eco friendly corral reef homes built on the sea. These houses would grow on water and be built to the surface for humans to also live in as well. Its a habitat in which relies on both humans and nature.</p>
