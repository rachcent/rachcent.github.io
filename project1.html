  <h3>Park 25 years from now.</h3>
<p>Have you ever wondered what statues, fountains, paintings comemerate in parks? This park is located in San Bruno on San Mateo Avenue. Along San Mateo avenue are many resturants, small businesses, a casino, and bars. The park is by West Coast Cafe. This park is under the protection of the Rotary Club. Each painting along the side of the building had paintings of a fox, race horse, a flower, etc. The fountain area is closed off. It's an odd place to put a park that's actually breached off. In this edit of the park, 25 years from now want it to have meaning. I imagine it actually having it not fenced in and for people to actually sit down. I imagine people taking a break walking over to the bank to get fresh air.</p>
