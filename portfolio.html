      <h3>SPOOPY, 2018</h3>
      <h4>3D Render</h4>
      <p>I worked on a still life SPOOPY  that I modeled on Maya. From doing this project, I realized that virtual scenes are different from looking at photography and paintings. Paintings and photography is 2D while virtual scenes are 3D in which we can look at the scene from different compositions. It’s easier to immerse yourself in virtual scenes than photography and paintings sometimes because you can explore it at a 360 kind of view unless the artist decides to hide things.

 I first modeled a wine glass using the EP curve tool, then decided to do the same with candles. Next, added a pumpkin and candy to make it more festive because it was October. From changing the textures of each object, makes it more realistic than it being smooth and shiny. I added an image texture to the pumpkin and changed the candle texture to wax.  I only added one light to the scene. In the future, I’d like to experiment with lighting more because lighting and adding different colors to the scene add certain moods to the project itself.

      <h3>Unplug, 2017</h3>
      <h4>Music video</h4>
      <h4> Running Time: 2 min, 36 seconds</h4>
      <p>I felt really inspired to create a music video after hearing the song “Datademon” by Lalaplux.This piece conveys the overconsumption of media and obsession of technology. In addition, there is so much content on the internet, that you can find yourself lost in there for hours.The endless amount of gifs, internet art, memes, and stock footage stays on the internet forever. I felt that sometimes, we should find time for ourselves to unplug from the always-connected internet world.

      <h3>Reality, 2017</h3>
      <h4>Animation
Running Time: 2 min, 21 seconds</h4>

      <p>The following  project that I worked on was an animation called Reality. The scenario is a first person exploring the different dimensions until a disturbance occurs.There are 4 scenes: crystal, stars, plants, and bedroom. I really wanted to tell a story and make something dream-like. I had trouble with camera work because the perspective is in first person. I wanted to look as if the viewer itself is walking through the sequences itself. The walk looked unnatural because it’s as if the person was gliding/floating through the dream in which a sense, achieves that dream state impression. In the future, I would like the dream sequences to be more immersive. I needed to crank up the FPS since I was messing with the speed on adobe premiere. In some of the scenes, it looked laggy and slow. Other than that, I’m glad how it turned out. I’d like to do a remake though. Timing on transitions could use some work, adding blinking transitions, adding the alarm clock drop scene, camera work. I edited the animation on adobe premiere.

The video “Goodbye Uncanny Valley,” discusses “the wilderness”, a part of cgi artists where they experiment and push the limits on what they can do with cgi programs. One of the artists is Kim Laughton which inspired me a lot creating this animation. A lot of what the artists on “the wilderness” seems to have a narrative or surreal sense, that they are testing using cgi programs. I just love how fun, whimsical, and also eerie their works have that I wanted to integrate that with this project.

        <h3>MELON BEAR, 2017</h3>
        <h4>Maya 2018, Adobe Premiere 2018 Running Time: 22 Seconds </h4>
        <p> The project Melon Bear that I worked on was an animation in where we had to create a self portrait of an avatar. If I ever had so associate myself with anything, it would be these things that I love. As a result, I designed a bear inspired by the game series Animal Crossing and the Japanese mascot character from San-X Rilakkuma. I like watermelon, so the bear is watermelon. I’m into EDM (electronic dance music), so the bear is wearing a rave tank. In the interview video, “Jacolby Satterwhite Dances with His Self”, Satterwhite says, “I think we’re in the age of a remix. There’s no such thing as originality anymore. And now it’s about how you use the information around you to generate your originality.” I feel like a lot of my ideas stem from inspirations of things that I enjoy. It wouldn’t be as fun and some ideas would have to come from somewhere other than yourself.

Creating this avatar that’s apart of me questioned about how avatars are created. Why we create them that way, how our behavior changes online/offline, and how people approach people online based on their avatar. Avatar customization allows us to express ourselves in ways we can’t wear or do in real life. Is this truly me or is this is how I want others to perceive of me as? What I wanted the bear to do was dance to electronic music. I had trouble rigging the bear. Every time I would make the “skeleton” of the bear, it would just move unnaturally. The bear of an arm and the neck/shoulder would move together. On Maya, I used the auto rig tool which automatically creates a skeleton for your character. Obviously, it’s not as accurate doing it yourself, but from autorigging, the bear’s arms, legs, head, torso, moved a little bit more naturally.</p>

        <h3>Boat, 2018</h3>
        <h4>Animation</h4>
        <p> I want to experiment using the Bifrost on Maya 2018. I’ve been inspired by video games such as The Last of Us, Dishonored, Spyro, and Bioshock infinite. Each video game has their own style of water based on thee physics, color, and how real it looks.  I’ve also been inspired by Hayao Miyazaki and Makoto Shinkai, both Japanese directors that work with animation. They all have beautiful scenery and each of them had different water physics. For example, the texture of the waves and splashes. The thing about water in video games is that it can look almost real and somewhat not natural. The way Hayao Miyazaki animated people crying ; the waterworks in their eyes are very dramatic, plump and round. The video “Goodbye Uncanny Valley” discusses “the wilderness” with how cgi artists experiment and push the boundaries of what cgi programs can do. This is what I wanted to do with this project. I wanted to experiment with water splashes, ripples against a boat, objects floating in water.

I used Maya and experimented with the bifrost tab. The bifrost on Maya is a procedural framework that can create simulated liquid and aerodynamic effects using a FLIP (fluid implicit particle) solver. I would have objects drop in a box of water to see how large the splashes are, based on how high and large the object is. I also tested to see the amount of water and how fluid the water drops down into the box. I also tested how much the boat rocks from the waves. This was everything I did before creating my final project. The plot of the animation was having a wooden boat hit against a toy boat from a lake.</p>

        <h3>Watermelon, 2018</h3>
        <h4>Video,Running Time: 55 Seconds</h4>
        <p>This video is about the desensitization of violence and gore that we see in movies, cartoons, video games, and on television. It also questions to what extent do we draw the line to put this type of content out there for the public to see. For others, violence and gore can be offensive and truly triggering for others to look at. Others find themselves intrigued and drawn to seek thrill and suspense because of the violent and gory content we see in media. </p>

        <h3>Empty Space, 2018 </h3>
        <h4>2 channel video installation with sound
Running Time:  1 min, 29 Seconds</h4>
        <p>This piece is an exploration about advertising and consumerism. We live in a world of advertising and see them on our day to day basis. They are plastered on subways, streets, stores, and phones. Advertisements are used to promote the products and push ideals onto us. The empty spaces of advertisements in contrast of the busy city streets of people walking communicates also loneliness. Despite the overwhelming amount of consumed products in our society, it doesn’t fill the void in our hearts. Many feel unsatisfied and left yearning for more. </p>
