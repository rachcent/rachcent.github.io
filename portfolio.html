      <h4>Zine</h4>
      <h5><a href="/brailleproject.html">View Vine Here!</a></h5>
      <p>#TUSAX(the user experience is as shitty as we expected), created by Near Future Laboratory, created a zine and invitation to bring out the poorly designed, malfunctioning things being placed into our world. Being an ethnographer and designer, created a zine to illustrate the unobserved, mundane, malfunctioning, misused, or out of place interactions. At McDonalds, I thought it was interesting that they have a sign posted at the drive thru saying that they have braille menus. It was funny at first because why would you post that at a drive thru? I can understand that maybe a passenger can be blind, so I wanted to know if it was true. That McDonalds truly cared about their customers. In this project, I have decided to visit 2 McDonalds drive thru to ask for braille menus. At the end of this experience, I thought it was kind of stupid that a large fast food chain has failed to offer people with disabilities to be inclusive as valuable customers.</p>

      <h3>SPOOPY, 2018</h3>
      <h4>3D Render</h4>
      <h5><a href="/spoopyproject.html">View SPOOPY here!</a></h5>
      <p>I worked on a still life SPOOPY  that I modeled on Maya. From doing this project, I realized that virtual scenes are different from looking at photography and paintings. Paintings and photography is 2D while virtual scenes are 3D in which we can look at the scene from different compositions. It’s easier to immerse yourself in virtual scenes than photography and paintings sometimes because you can explore it at a 360 kind of view unless the artist decides to hide things.

 I first modeled a wine glass using the EP curve tool, then decided to do the same with candles. Next, added a pumpkin and candy to make it more festive because it was October. From changing the textures of each object, makes it more realistic than it being smooth and shiny. I added an image texture to the pumpkin and changed the candle texture to wax.  I only added one light to the scene. In the future, I’d like to experiment with lighting more because lighting and adding different colors to the scene add certain moods to the project itself.

      <h3>Unplug, 2017</h3>
      <h4>Music video</h4>
      <h4> Running Time: 2 min, 36 seconds</h4>
      <p>I felt really inspired to create a music video after hearing the song “Datademon” by Lalaplux.This piece conveys the overconsumption of media and obsession of technology. In addition, there is so much content on the internet, that you can find yourself lost in there for hours.The endless amount of gifs, internet art, memes, and stock footage stays on the internet forever. I felt that sometimes, we should find time for ourselves to unplug from the always-connected internet world.

      <h3>Reality, 2017</h3>
      <h4>Animation
Running Time: 2 min, 21 seconds</h4>

      <p>The following  project that I worked on was an animation called Reality. The scenario is a first person exploring the different dimensions until a disturbance occurs.There are 4 scenes: crystal, stars, plants, and bedroom. I really wanted to tell a story and make something dream-like. I had trouble with camera work because the perspective is in first person. I wanted to look as if the viewer itself is walking through the sequences itself. The walk looked unnatural because it’s as if the person was gliding/floating through the dream in which a sense, achieves that dream state impression. In the future, I would like the dream sequences to be more immersive. I needed to crank up the FPS since I was messing with the speed on adobe premiere. In some of the scenes, it looked laggy and slow. Other than that, I’m glad how it turned out. I’d like to do a remake though. Timing on transitions could use some work, adding blinking transitions, adding the alarm clock drop scene, camera work. I edited the animation on adobe premiere.

The video “Goodbye Uncanny Valley,” discusses “the wilderness”, a part of cgi artists where they experiment and push the limits on what they can do with cgi programs. One of the artists is Kim Laughton which inspired me a lot creating this animation. A lot of what the artists on “the wilderness” seems to have a narrative or surreal sense, that they are testing using cgi programs. I just love how fun, whimsical, and also eerie their works have that I wanted to integrate that with this project.

        <h3>MELON BEAR, 2017</h3>
        <h4>Maya 2018, Adobe Premiere 2018 Running Time: 22 Seconds </h4>
        <p> The project Melon Bear that I worked on was an animation in where we had to create a self portrait of an avatar. If I ever had so associate myself with anything, it would be these things that I love. As a result, I designed a bear inspired by the game series Animal Crossing and the Japanese mascot character from San-X Rilakkuma. I like watermelon, so the bear is watermelon. I’m into EDM (electronic dance music), so the bear is wearing a rave tank. In the interview video, “Jacolby Satterwhite Dances with His Self”, Satterwhite says, “I think we’re in the age of a remix. There’s no such thing as originality anymore. And now it’s about how you use the information around you to generate your originality.” I feel like a lot of my ideas stem from inspirations of things that I enjoy. It wouldn’t be as fun and some ideas would have to come from somewhere other than yourself.

Creating this avatar that’s apart of me questioned about how avatars are created. Why we create them that way, how our behavior changes online/offline, and how people approach people online based on their avatar. Avatar customization allows us to express ourselves in ways we can’t wear or do in real life. Is this truly me or is this is how I want others to perceive of me as? What I wanted the bear to do was dance to electronic music. I had trouble rigging the bear. Every time I would make the “skeleton” of the bear, it would just move unnaturally. The bear of an arm and the neck/shoulder would move together. On Maya, I used the auto rig tool which automatically creates a skeleton for your character. Obviously, it’s not as accurate doing it yourself, but from autorigging, the bear’s arms, legs, head, torso, moved a little bit more naturally.</p>

        <h3>Watermelon, 2018</h3>
        <h4>Video,Running Time: 55 Seconds</h4>
        <p>This video is about the desensitization of violence and gore that we see in movies, cartoons, video games, and on television. It also questions to what extent do we draw the line to put this type of content out there for the public to see. For others, violence and gore can be offensive and truly triggering for others to look at. Others find themselves intrigued and drawn to seek thrill and suspense because of the violent and gory content we see in media. </p>

        <h3>Empty Space, 2018 </h3>
        <h4>2 channel video installation with sound
Running Time:  1 min, 29 Seconds</h4>
        <p>This piece is an exploration about advertising and consumerism. We live in a world of advertising and see them on our day to day basis. They are plastered on subways, streets, stores, and phones. Advertisements are used to promote the products and push ideals onto us. The empty spaces of advertisements in contrast of the busy city streets of people walking communicates also loneliness. Despite the overwhelming amount of consumed products in our society, it doesn’t fill the void in our hearts. Many feel unsatisfied and left yearning for more. </p>

      <h3>GOOD PUP, 2018 </h3>
      <h4> GOOD PUP, Maya 2018, 9/12/17</h4>
      <h5><a href="/goodpupproject.html">View full image here!</a></h5>

      <p>In GOOD PUP, I rendered my dog using Kinect and 3D scan and imported to Maya to manipulate and edit. Using Maya, I added prosthetics, such as a radio device to communicate with my dog, spikes, and missiles to her back. It looked very whimsical and quirky at first, but I was also inspired by the idea of how things digital are kept forever. A tech company in South Korea created an app that uses 3D scanning and artificial intelligence in order to create avatars of those who passed away. With the “With Me” app it digitally recreates the person that passed away into avatars. You can interact with your passed loved ones avatar by talking to them. The avatar would respond back saying, “I love you too”. There are arguments saying that because the avatar of the passed loved one isn’t real, it doesn’t satisfy the void left from their passing. However, these avatars provided the users a sense of closure for them by allowing them to interact with their loved ones once more. Using  Maya was completely new to me. I had such a hard time learning how to model that I only used basic shapes to create real life objects. Using the Kinect took a couples tries to scan my dog because my laptop could not handle running the program. I would have to restart my laptop for every scan I did. I also wanted to color my dog because she blended in with the background but, had no idea how to do so. Watching Sophie Khan’s lightning talk about her sculptural 3d scanned and printed “death masks”, I find it really eerie and somehow bittersweet about Khan’s art pieces and the meaning behind each death mask that she created. It’s like what a lot of people say when someone passes away and they see their loved ones in a casket. They look like it’s not them anymore.  </p>

        <h4>Photomanipulation, Adobe Photoshop 2017</h4>
        <h5><a href="/parkchangeproject.html">View project here!</a></h5>
  <h6>Park 25 years from now.</h6>
<p> This project was to find a location and think about the changes it will have over the years. We used photoshop to alter the images. Have you ever wondered what statues, fountains, paintings comemerate in parks? This park is located in San Bruno on San Mateo Avenue. Along San Mateo avenue are many resturants, small businesses, a casino, and bars. The park is by West Coast Cafe. This park is under the protection of the Rotary Club. Each painting along the side of the building had paintings of a fox, race horse, a flower, etc. The fountain area is closed off. It's an odd place to put a park that's actually breached off. In this edit of the park, 25 years from now want it to have meaning. I imagine it actually having it not fenced in and for people to actually sit down. I imagine people taking a break walking over to the bank to get fresh air.  </p>

    <h3>HOUSE, 2017 </h3>
    <h4>Maya 2018</h4>
    <h5><a href="/houseproject.html">View project here!</a></h5>
<p> The project HOUSE  I worked on was a 3d print. I modeled a house and tree on Maya 2018 and 3d printed using the lulzbot mini. That took about fifteen minutes to print. It turns out I used the wrong setting for printing. I forgot what the setting was, but basically the temperature of the plastic was not high enough to make the objects form together well. On the edges of the print, there are gaps that didn’t fill in between the part of the house. I just thought that producing small visuals of larger landscapes such as designing new buildings, plane models, etc., then 3D modeling and printing would be convenient. Objects can be added to the scene and can easily be manipulated to remove and add. When people use materials such as wood and clay, it’s a permanent decision to remove and carve away the mediums. Of course, you can add more clay, or more wood, but with just a click of a button, it’s more convenient to add or remove objects using a 3D program when it comes to 3D printing.  </p>
