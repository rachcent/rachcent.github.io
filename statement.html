  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>My work consists of drawing, video, and animation.
  <p>Iâ€™m Rachel Centinaje, a digital media artist working with printmaking, video, 3D modeling, and illustration. Art has helped me gain insight about the world and myself. A lot of my inspiration comes from digital artists, nostalgia, film, video games, and pop culture. When I consume things, I like to remix it to form my interpretation. Digital artists Jonathan Zawada, Quentin Deronzier, and Kim Laughton influence my works because it looks dreamlike, whimsical, and odd, transporting the viewer to an unfamiliar world, but at the same brings out familiarness. It inspires me to create art and reflect that in my own style and works. My current work explores the relationship between digital technology and culture along with the psychological effects it has on us, especially with this odd transition between the old world and new technology.
