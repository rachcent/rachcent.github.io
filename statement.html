  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>Hi! I’m Rachel Centinaje and I like working with printmaking, filming, 3D modeling, and illustrating. I’ve learned more about the world and myself through art. At a young age, I’ve used the computer and has used it as a tool for self expression. A lot of my inspiration comes from digital artists, nostalgia, film, videogames, and internet culture. Digital artists I’m influenced by are Jonathan Zawada, Quentin Deronzier, and Kim Laughton. I love their works because it looks surreal, whimsical, and odd. It makes me want to create art and reflect that in my own style and works. My current work is about the relationship between digital technology and culture along with the psychological effects it has on us.
