  <p>Hi! I’m Rachel Centinaje and I like working with printmaking, video, 3D modeling, and illustration. Art has helped me gain insight about the world and myself. At a young age, I’ve used the computer as a tool for self expression. A lot of my inspiration comes from digital artists, nostalgia, film, videogames, and pop culture. Digital artists I’m influenced by are Jonathan Zawada, Quentin Deronzier, and Kim Laughton. I love their works because it looks surreal, whimsical, and odd, transporting the viewer to an unfamiliar world. It inspires me to create art and reflect that in my own style and works. My current work is about the relationship between digital technology and culture along with the psychological effects it has on us.
