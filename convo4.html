      basically i explained that I never expected I would find such great friends online like you guys
    </p>
    <p>
      and I think you and a few others are as real of friends as the ones I see everyday
    </p>
    <p>
      and then I went on to say how we've never argued or fought and thats a wonderful sign
    </p>
