<div class="section1">

<p> 1. What is a good working definition of what a System is and perhaps what it is not? </p>

<p>On miriam dictionary, a system is defined as a regularly interacting or interdependent group of items forming a unified whole. A system is interdependent, so what makes it not a system is if something/item can perform by itself and is independent. A system requires everything to work together as a unified whole to serve a common process. What makes it not a system is if they’re not related and don’t serve a common process.</p>

<p> 2. For the 4 system definitions you were to look up please give in your own words what they mean and give an example of them for each case.

<p> <ul><li>Modularity- parts of a system that has multifunctional uses and also interchangeable. Ex. An example would be a nintendo 3ds, can be played hand held or on the tv. Another example is lego pieces. Can take them apart and create something new. A programming code that can be used as different functions.</li>
<li>Decomposability- cannot be broken down into smaller components or else it loses its function. Ex. Taking down a tent, elements of periodic table,laptop parts, computer parts. </li>
<li>Emergence- when smaller components with different processes are team up together, they combine together to form a new process together. Ex. person riding a bike and the bike itself</li>.
<li>Chaos Theory-unpredicular behavior of dynamic systems that are sensitive to initial conditions and can react in a completely different way. Ex.bouncing a ball</li> </p>
</ul>
<p>3. Give us your definition of what Tesslation means and give an example you encountered, not mentioned in the reading.</p>

<p>A tessellation is a repetitive pattern of a shape or polygon, that fills the space  with no gaps or overlaps. An example is seeing brick walls on houses

<p>4. What is The difference between ideas of Modularity and Tesselation? What are the properties that are in oppostion with each other?</p>

<p>Modularity is different components of a system in which the components can be separated or recombined and tessellation sorta has its limits on how it fills a gap and how it is utilized. f With modularity, the components can be reused again for different purposes.

<p>5. What is the difference between designing something that has Complexity (aperiodic) vs being Uniform (periodic)</p>

<p>Aperiodic doesn’t have a repeating pattern while Uniform doesn’t.</p>

<p> 6. Group Activity. Each student will need to Bring in a series of 8 diagrams that show evidence of Modularity, Decomposability, Emergence and Chaos Theory.</p>
