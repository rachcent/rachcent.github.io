    <p>  This 1st project, I wanted to “highlight” stretch marks instead of it being hidden. There are many beauty apps like snow, snapchat, and programs like photoshop that are being used to manipulate and distort people’s bodies and faces to make them look flawless. Usually, we see those edits in movies, tv shows, Hollywood, but now it’s easily accessible to the public. I really wanted people to feel more comfortable in their own skin/bodies and for people to own up to it.
I photographed these images, used Paint Tool SAI to draw over the stretch marks, adobe premiere to make the animated video, then unity. </p>
